# PSV2N

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a shortest path-based algorithm named PS-V2N (Proximity Score of Vertex to Network) which was proposed for the target identification.

## Installation

You can install the released version of PSV2N from [github](https://github.com/windforclouds/PSV2N) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
github_install("windforclouds/PSV2N")
library(PSV2N)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r GOplot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(PSV2N)
## basic example code
GOplot(vertex_sample[,1])
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r annotation_gene, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
annotation_gene(vertex_sample[1:5,1])
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.


In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
